## ðŸš€ About Me
### Marketing Executive || Data Analyst  || Business development executive
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Insu Patle, an MBA student with a strong passion for Marketing, Brand Strategy, and Consumer Insights. For me, marketing feels like solving exciting puzzles â€” finding the right way to connect businesses with people!

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m currently pursuing my MBA at ISMS Sankalp Business School, Pune (2024â€“2026), after completing my BA in Economics. Along the way, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience through internships at ShipCube and Shabaka Agrimanufex LLP, where I worked on digital marketing campaigns, market research, and international business strategies.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly leveling up my skills in digital marketing, sales management, and marketing analytics. I believe data-driven strategies and creative ideas together can shape powerful brands and drive real growth.

ðŸ“Š As a budding Marketing Professional, I enjoy exploring consumer behavior, global markets, and innovative marketing tools. My mission is to help businesses tell their story in a way that inspires, engages, and builds lasting connections.

ðŸŽ¸ Beyond academics, I love challenging myself with new experiences â€” from traveling and exploring cultures to creative pursuits that fuel my curiosity and storytelling mindset.

ðŸ“« Want to collaborate on exciting marketing projects or discuss business growth strategies? Letâ€™s connect on LinkedIn and create impactful stories together!
